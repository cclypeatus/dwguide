- Joining a guild: You can see the list of available guilds under the GUILDS category. The guilds are player managed, and the requirements of joining a guild vary. Some guilds require members to be over a certain level threshold, or be of a certain class. Check their pinned messages for such requirements or inquire with their leader if they don't specify any.
- All guilds created must be based in Snowhaven and cannot be branches of other guilds.
- When you submit a new guild in ⁠guild-registry, react to your proposal with 🏢 (`:office:`).
