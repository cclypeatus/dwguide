D&D Beyond (DDB) is one of the three character sheet tools we accept on the server. However, it only allows non-paying users access to the Basic Rules for character creation, which is even more limiting than just PHB. 

With the support of our patrons as well as a club account from D&D Beyond, we are able to provide you with all paid material via content sharing links. We highly encourage you to donate any amount you can afford so we can purchase more links.

To benefit from this perk, fill in the template below and post it in [#ddb-link-request](https://discordapp.com/channels/512870694883950598/756319993616138310). A staff member will then send you a link via PMs. Posts marked with a âœ… indicate that they have been processed and the link sent out.

## Rules

- For security purposes, do not share these links with others, whether on this server or externally.

- These campaigns are merely placeholders, and all provide the same content. They do not guarantee spots in bounties.

- Only use the campaign links for characters that you are using on this server. Only after you have achieved the Active Player role can you add characters from outside the server.

- If you leave the server, your character will be removed from the campaigns

- Please claim your characters. Unnamed/unassigned characters will be removed.

- Do not reserve a slot for yourself for later. 

- Inactivity (1 month with no messages; messages in bot-dump don't count) will result in your character being removed

- All your characters should be added to the same link. To retrieve the link of your current campaign, on the DDB website click "Collections", then "My Campaigns", then "View Campaign". You should see the link. (You need to have already redeemed a campaign link for this to work)
