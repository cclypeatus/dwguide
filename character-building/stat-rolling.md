## Important
- It is **optional** to roll for stats/gold/hp. However, once you have made the rolls, you **must** use the rolled results.
<br><br>
- You only get one roll per character.
- Only the rolls made in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" text="#official-character-rolls"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513963351567499264) are valid.<br>
<br><br>
- All test rolls should be done in `#bot-dump`.
- Upload your character sheets in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" text="#character-sheets"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/512872392377499661), not [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" text="#official-character-rolls"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513963351567499264).

## Rolling for Stats

> - Use `!rollstats` to roll. 
> All rolls generated by other aliases are **not** valid. 
> - You can arrange the rolled stats into ability scores in any order.
> - You can only roll stats for character slots you have available. Any excess stats rolled in this channel will be deleted.

==- **For D&D Beyond Users**

!!!danger
**Do not roll stats/HP/gold on DnD Beyond.**

Change your stat generation method to "Manual/Rolled" and put your scores in the boxes on the top. Racial bonus and any other bonuses get automatically applied. Do **not** put the numbers in the override scores.

## Rolling for HP

> - Indicate that you are rolling for HP using this format:<br>
> `!r d# [Character Name] Level # HP`<br>
> e.g. `!r d6 Rand Level 6 HP`

### Note on HP

> - At Level 1 <br>
> You take the highest-possible roll of your Hit Die + your Constitution modifier.
> <br><br>
> - Beyond 1st Level<br>
> \+ Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die from your class.<br>
> \+ For each level, you can choose to either roll this new hit die or use the "fixed value" shown in your class entry, then add your constitution modifier.
