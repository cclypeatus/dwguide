This channel contains the rules for character creation. For the starting guide to the server, please head over to [Start Here](start-here.md).

## Start

- :warning: We use the **2014 D&D 5e ruleset**. :warning: 
 - If you are using D&D Beyond, these options will be marked with the `[Legacy]` tag.

- Your characters start at **Level 1**.

### Transferring Characters from Other Servers/Campaigns
You cannot transfer characters from other places. However, you can create a version of them in this server following the same creation process as any other new characters.

## Character Sheet Options

> You must use a sheet compatible with **Avrae** Discord bot. The following are all free to use. Your options are:
> - [**D&D Beyond**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) (Best for newbies)
> - [**GSheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DtJ9AYC_BWUuvP85UqVBBscQO8DhZF8ArAdZnjUO0WM)
> - [**DiceCloud v1**](https://v1.dicecloud.com/)
> - [**DiceCloud v2**](https://dicecloud.com/)

> - DiceCloud and GSheet are better for homebrew. DiceCloud takes some learning, so it is recommended for more experienced players.
> - GSheet is the closest to a paper sheet/fillable pdf, so if you are used to those methods, you may find GSheet the easiest.
> - Mythweavers, character sheet apps, and pdfs are not compatible with Avrae.

+++ D&D Beyond
[D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/)

There is also a newbie-friendly step-by-step guide in [New to D&D](new-to-dnd.md).

Character Preferences (settings)
> - **Sources**: Homebrew Content, Expanded Rules, Legacy, Critical Role Content
> 
> !!!warning Not everything from these sources is allowed to be used in the server.
> Please refer to the later "Sources" section of this channel for full details.
> !!!
> - **Dice Rolling**: Off (We use Avrae Discord bot for dice rolls)
> - **Optional Features**: On
> - **Advancement Type**: Milestone
> - **Hit Point Type**: "Fixed" is recommended. If you choose "Manual", you **must** make the rolls in `#official-character-rolls` channel, **not** in D&D Beyond
> - **Encumbrance Type**: Use Encumbrance
> - **Ignore Coin Weight**: Off
> - **Character Privacy**: Public
> 
> Leave the rest of the options as they are.

Once you created a character on D&D Beyond, make sure to do the following:
> - Equip your weapons and armor by clicking on the box next to them in the equipment page.
> - If you decide to roll for HP in `#official-character-rolls`, you will need to manually enter your HP.

> - UA that gets officially released or revisited later in another UA is banned.
> - Any UA content that hasn't been vetted for approval yet isn't allowed. Therefore, if it is not in the approved UA section, it is not allowed.

> - You cannot multiclass with Homebrew and UA classes/subclasses due to balance reasons.
> - If you plan on using Homebrew or UA content, we highly recommend you to use GSheet or DiceCloud sheets due to various limitations of D&D Beyond's Homebrew system.

> - Try not to double up on character names with an Active Player to minimize confusion. Use the Discord search function to see if someone else has a similar or especially the exact same name, and preferably use a different one.

**Age**

> - You also may not play a character who behaves drastically younger than their actual age, i.e. overtly childish behavior.

![](/images/race-age-chart.png)

## Character Backstory

- It is important to note that your character's backstory will most likely not be explored here. Hence, the backstory is primarily for your roleplay.
- By submitting your backstory and lore to this server, you agree that it becomes open to DM interpretation.

### Level 1 Character in a Collaborative Story

> - What you did in your backstory must make sense for a Level 1 character's capabilities. For example, you cannot be famous or notorious at the world-wide scale, or have committed mass slaughter.
> - Beware of Chosen One Syndrome. You are a part of the collaborative storytelling, not the main character of a novel.
> 
> - Your backstory cannot contain any non-family-friendly topics such as sexual assault of any degree, slavery, pedophilia, etc. When in doubt, err on the side of caution, or in case you are unsure, send a message to `@FanMail` for confirmation.

### World Setting

> - The world map and general world setting information can be found in `#lore` 
> - If you have any lore questions for your backstory, message `@FanMail` with the specific question and motive. 
> - The pantheon of Icris can be found in `#pantheon`, and the Members of the Council (Archdevils) can be found in `#hell-inc`
> 
> !!!warning
> No guns or firearm lookalikes exist in this world. No sci-fi, no references to other franchises, no urban technology, no references to events on Earth.
> !!!
> 
> For more DnD World lore, please visit our [World Anvil page](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/icris-dnd-world).
> 
> - Your backstory must take place in Icris. You cannot be a planeshifter, come from another plane such as the Feywild/Shadowfell/Elemental Planes, or come from another continent or Underdark.
> - You cannot invent major world changing events such as natural disasters or war.
> - You cannot be in a current/former position of royalty, e.g. King/Queen, Prince/Princess.
> 
> - You cannot follow a god from another pantheon (e.g. Forgotten Realms) and you cannot invent your own god.
> - If you are a cleric, you must follow god(s) from Icris pantheon: `#pantheon`.

### Miscellaneous

> - Your backstory cannot be based off religious text such as the Bible, or directly pulled from a video game/book series/franchise. 
> - Your backstory cannot have far-fetched concepts like being frozen in time, or contain powerful or legendary magic items.
> 
> - It is optional, but recommended, that you write your backstory in `#character-biopic`.

## Equipment

> - You may take starting equipment **__or__** roll for gold.
> - If you choose to take starting equipment, the item must be available in the market. All PHB mundane items are included with the same price. 
> [Snowhaven Market Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/131lUJSH1DX0FLMfKKlO9irCnfG6zjwbjjG5-HKstWsU)
> 
> - If you choose to roll for gold, follow the instructions pinned in `#official-character-rolls`. Once you have made the roll, you must use the rolled result and you cannot take equipment or gold from your class or background.
>   - After you have rolled the gold, you may then purchase the equipment from the above document, and by logging the transactions in the `#transaction-log`. 
> 
> - You are **__not__** allowed to possess any magic items starting out.

## Rules for Multiple Characters

> - You start with **2 character slots** on this server. You can gain extra character slots by becoming a [patron](https://www.patreon.com/Dndworld) or taking on certain staff roles.

> - You may make your additional characters any time, following the same procedure as your first character. 

> - You cannot sign up for, or go on the same quest with both characters, as per [Roleplay Rules 11](/rp-rules/). 
> - If you are roleplaying more than one character at the same time, you can only gain RPXP for one of them during that period.
> 
> - Your characters cannot be in the same guild.
> - Your characters cannot benefit from each other's presence, e.g. they cannot give each other items or gold.

## Character Creation Phase

After you create your character and before the character attends a DM event, the character is considered to be in the character creation phase. During this time, you may change parts of the character as many times as you want. Following rules apply:

> - You must keep all rolled results. If you have rolled the stats, you cannot switch back to Standard Array or Point Buy.
> - If you chose Standard Array or Point buy as the Ability Score generation method, you may switch to rolling for stats. Please note, once you rolled the stats, you must use them.
> - You may not switch between choosing starting equipment and rolling for gold.
> - You may not reroll stats / gold / hp.

> - If any of the starting equipment were sold and you need to switch them, retcon the transaction before doing so.
> - Keep RPXP and Experience counter values.

> - You are still in the character creation phase after gaining XP from Combat Training DTD, an approved RPXP claim, or Avrae Tutorial XP.

!!!warning 
Once your character participates in a DM event, all rebuilds must be submitted for review in `#rebuild-retire-log`, following the rules in the pin.
!!!

## Beyond 1st Level

### Gaining a Level

> - [How to Earn XP](/start-playing/earn-xp/) lists all the ways you can gain XP. Please note that RPXP is separate from XP. Full details can be found in the channel.
> - Once you updated the character sheet, run `!update` and `!level` in `#bot-dump`. You may need to set the subclass manually by running `!level [class] [subclass]`.
> - Once your character gains a level, make sure to change your reacts in `#roles` in order to receive the game post pings for the new level.
> - Please note, "Changing Your Subclass" section from Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (TCoE) is not allowed. You may change the subclass of a character following the rebuild rules in `#rebuild-retire-log`.

### Multiclass

> You are allowed to multiclass when you level up, as long as you meet the standard stat prerequisites.

### ASI/Feat

> You are allowed to take a feat instead of taking Ability Score Improvement (ASI), when the class gives you the option at certain levels.

### Rebuild

> Please refer to `#rebuild-retire-log` pin for full details on rebuild.

### Character Death / Retire

> - Character death needs to be recorded in `#list-of-the-fallen`. Full details on how to make the record, what to do next, and information on Cushion Rule can be found in the channel pin.
> - You may retire your character if they are at least Level 4 and it has been at least 1 month since your last retire. Full details on Retiring can be found in `#rebuild-retire-log` channel pin and Cushion Rule in `#claims-log`.

## :warning: Returning Players/Inactivity

Whether you leave the server and return after some period of time, or you have been inactive on the server for some time, your characters do **not** automatically reset. You must keep all rolled results, as well as the characters created before the leave or inactivity. 

### Invalid Stats Rebuild
If you have a roll made before 11 August 2020, you may reroll for it provided you lack one of the following:
- 70 or above in total stats
- At least one 14 or above
- Separate stat of at least one 15 or above

To reroll, please declare which character you are rerolling for, then run `!generate` ONCE in `#official-character-rolls`. You may choose between your new and previous roll:
- To use your new roll, submit the [Invalid Stats rebuild form](<https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/542953099560615946/941343439428145223>) in `#rebuild-retire-log` and wait for it to be processed.
- To keep your previous roll, react ❌ on the new roll.

### Fresh Start
- In case you have been away for a significant amount of time, we allow you to mass retire all of your characters. In this case only one of them is eligible for the Cushion Rule. You are not required to do Fresh Start if you have been away, but if you choose to do fresh start, it applies to all characters you had.
- Fresh Start is approved on a case-by-case basis. Please fill in the following form and send it to `#rebuild-retire-log` and wait for the request to be reviewed.
