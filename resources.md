### How to connect your D&D Beyond account to view features on Avrae
!!!Note 
Avrae uses D&D Beyond to fetch and display content, so even if you use Gsheet or Dicecloud, you must connect your Discord and D&D Beyond accounts to use features from paid content on Avrae, e.g. spells, classfeats.
!!!
- Make a D&D Beyond account.
- Go to the [Account page](https://www.dndbeyond.com/account) to link it to your Discord account.

- Make a `#ddb-link-request` to receive a DDB campaign link. 
!!!Note
DDB's content sharing feature lets characters in the same campaign share access to any owned content. We offer these links to rules-abiding members so they may benefit from this for free.
!!!

- Once you receive it, open the campaign link and click "Create Character". Your character's name will default to  `<yourUsername>'s Character`. You can leave this as-is if you aren't using DDB for your sheets.
- If you are not using DDB sheets, then you are done! You will now have access DDB content on Avrae while your character stays in the campaign.

### How to add a note (for Gsheet character sheets)

!!!
A general guide for making a Gsheet character sheet can be found in the sheet itself. Thoroughly read through the [**?**] tab and follow the instruction.
!!!

A **note** in google sheet is the small tooltip that pops up when you hover over the cell. Gsheet character sheet has various instructions and information already in them, and you are encouraged to add yours whenever necessary.

To add a note, right click on a cell, and select "Insert note".

Example

Example character sheet with notes containing full text of each feature.

### How to get your character sheet's link from the D&D Beyond mobile app

!!!
Make sure your character sheet is set to **Public**.
!!!

- Click on the `Menu` button (9 red dots) and go to: `View Character on Website`
- Click `Manage` (next to your character's name)

!!!
To set your character sheet to PUBLIC: Click `Character Settings`, scroll down and set Character Privacy to `Public`. Then go back to `Manage`
!!!

- To get your character sheet's link, click `Shareable Link`, and copy the link.
- Go to ‚Å†`#character-sheets`, and run `!import <link>`, replacing `<link>` with the URL you just copied. 

You're now ready to start playing!
