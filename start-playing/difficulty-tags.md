## Game Board Posts

### Basic tags indicating difficulty

- **Easy.** The party is expected to cruise through pretty comfortably, with plenty of room for error.
- **Moderate.** The standard difficulty setting. Things might go poorly if players take unnecessary risks or have very bad luck.
- **Challenging.** A certain level of skill or power might be required to succeed relatively unscathed. Strategy, caution, and planning are recommended; things could go quite badly otherwise.
- **Perilous.** A test of your skill; merely surviving will be a challenge. Caution, risk management, and strategy are the foundations of success here. This may be an adventure with encounters, traps, or situations that are highly dangerous, or possibly even unbeatable.

### Example tags indicating the type of bounty

- **Combat focus.** Most of the bounty duration is expected to be in combat.
- **RP focus.** Most of the bounty duration is expected to be out of combat.
- **Puzzler.** You'll need your thinking hat for this one. Expect mysteries to solve, or challenges of wit or strategy.

### Examples tags offering extra detail

- **No risk.** There are no stakes; nothing can go wrong, there can be no negative outcome. Enjoy the ride.
- **No risk of death.** Even if you die, you won't die. Standard for arena fights.
- **Suffering.** High risk of participants experiencing emotional pain, maiming, insanity, and/or other forms of torment.


## Game Signups

Please review [Roleplay Rules](/rp-rules.md) in its entirety. Here are two of the rules that are relevant to the game signups.

==- 1Ô∏è0Ô∏è **Multiple signups for DM events**
You may sign up to multiple DM events. However, once a character is accepted to an event, all other signups __with that character__ need to be removed.

After a DM event, if you have sign-ups for other events, make sure to update the "last event" date.
==- 1Ô∏è1Ô∏è **Only one character per player may sign up for each DM event.**
===

### Format for Logging Last Game for QLs
If a DM requires you to provide the date of your last game on your signup sheet, please use the following template.

```
<Game Title> <Last Session Date> <Completed/Ongoing>
```

Applies if you:
- Are currently in a questlock
- Just completed a questlock
- Last game was a questlock (even if it is many months/years ago)

!!!
üìÜ **Please use a YYYY/MM/DD format for the date**
!!!

!!!warning If you are currently QLed, you cannot join another game with the same character QLed (because they can't be in two places at once). Any signups must be made with a different character.
!!!
