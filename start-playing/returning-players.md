# Returning Players/Inactivity

Whether you leave the server and return after some period of time, or you have been inactive on the server for some time, your characters do **not** automatically reset. You must keep all rolled results, as well as the characters created before the leave or inactivity. 

### Fresh Start
- In case you have been away for a significant amount of time (at least 6 months), we allow you to mass retire all of your characters. In this case only one of them is eligible for the Cushion Rule. You are not required to do Fresh Start if you have been away, but if you choose to do fresh start, it applies to all characters you had.
- Fresh Start is approved on a case-by-case basis. Please fill in the following form and send it to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#rebuild-retire-log"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/542953099560615946) and wait for the request to be reviewed.
