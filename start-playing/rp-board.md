[This channel](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/893946822404493392) is for you to indicate to other players that you are seeking RP. Use this channel to request for:

- ‚úÖ Slower paced or 1 to 1 RP (suitable for overwhelmed newbies)
- ‚úÖ Scheduled RP with another player
- ‚úÖ Doing something specific (e.g. sparring, fishing, touring the town)

- ‚ùå Asking for permission to use RP channels  (that is not required - you can walk straight in)
- ‚ùå Encounters with NPCs (that is [`#npc-registry`](/advanced-play/npc-registry))
- ‚ùå Advertising campaigns (that is not allowed on the server)

Before making your own post, consider checking the queue to see if another RPer has already made one that matches your description and ping them to RP.

Delete your post once you have found a partner.

Please keep this channel discussion free and open a thread from someone's post or ping them in the OOC channel of their channel of choice if you are interested in RPing with them or would like to comment on their post.
