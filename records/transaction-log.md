All purchases, sales, and trades should be recorded in [#transaction-log](https://discordapp.com/channels/512870694883950598/531011819095982081).

## Making Transactions

> - Transaction Command:
> ```
> !transaction "<reason>" +Xgp
> ```
> Replace `<reason>` with the reason for your transaction, and keep the quotation marks. Please see the examples below.
> <br><br>
> - [Example] Adding Starting Gold:
> ```
> !transaction "Starting Gold: Folk Hero Background" +10gp
> ```
> - The command does not support decimals. Instead, you may use more than one currency at once:
> ```
> !transaction "Paying the bills" -7gp -5sp -11cp
> ```

## Coin Purse

> - `!transaction`: shows the coin purse.
> - `!transaction marks`: shows the coin purse including the Black Marks.
> <br><br>
> - `!csettings` > Cosmetic Settings > Toggle Compact Coin Display: to toggle the compact view. A compact view only shows the total in gp, instead of showing individual coin types.
> - `!coins convert` - Converts all of your coins into the highest value coins possible.

## Black Marks

> - `!transaction "Reason" +/-<amount>m`<br>
> Example: ```!transaction "Pit Fight: Pitmaster Returns" +2m```
