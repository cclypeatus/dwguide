## Introduction

Hello gamers! Ok that title was mostly a joke, but if you’re someone who just got into D&D and are struggling to assimilate to how D&D is played as compared to video games or just struggling in general, then you have come to the right place. 

This document is designed to explain the differences between more conventional modes of entertainment and D&D, so that you can manage your expectations when you play. You are advised to check out [A Guide to Navigating Large Servers](/tips/navigating-large-servers.md) if you are also unfamiliar with large servers in general.

Please note that this won’t actually teach you how to play D&D; for that, you should check out the [Basic Rules](https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf).

Let’s get started!

## Playstyle Differences

### Games Are Not On Demand

In a video game, you can usually play a game whenever you want to (if single player) or queue for a match and get matched pretty quickly (if multiplayer). However, for D&D, as games are hosted by a human (the DM) with a life, it is subject to availability. In addition, each game is unique, and needs preparation. D&D is traditionally played once a week, but is realistically less often depending on availability. 

### Games Take a Long Time

Games that are designed to be short such as arenas and pits typically take less than 2 hours. However, for bounties, these can usually take upwards of 6 hours, with 8 or even 10 hour games being normal. It is considered bad manners to abandon a game midway, and is an offense that will warrant Demerit Points on the server. As such, please ensure you can commit for the entire duration before signing up.

### Game Rules are Complex (and may not even have definite rulings)

D&D rulebooks are written in the style that should only be taken as a guideline and DMs have the final say. Despite mass protests by D&D players over the years that this is a flawed reasoning that relies on the DM to have a good judgment ability lest unforeseen consequences occur and they have paid for a rulebook to, well, communicate rules, these complaints have gone mostly unheard.

The result is in the following:
- Core rulebooks have many rules to cover the potentially infinite scenarios that can arise from D&D
- Rules that are unclear are clarified in Sage Advice, which was once Jeremy Crawford’s (co-designer) twitter feed and is now an occasional pdf published on D&D’s website. These are referred to “rulings”, as they depend on interpretation and are not necessarily the correct form of a rule.
- Rulings that are still unclear or the server deems are interpreted incorrectly are overridden in [the Erratas and Clarifications page](/faq/erratas.md).
- DMs may have their own house rules if they choose to rule something differently

As such, a lot of the game requires reading. We recommend you start with [the Basic Rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules). Please ask questions in [`#server-questions`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/546725434608451584), as this is the easiest way to clarify what you are unsure about and prevent rule breaking.

### Games Emphasize Teamwork

Those who play multiplayer games are usually familiar with this concept, but here is an explanation for those who mostly play single player games. In single player games, you have more flexibility to play how you want, and you can go off and choose to kill the villager just to see the consequences.

In D&D, being a lone wolf is a generally ineffective strategy and will likely lead to disappointment. Much of Dnd World relies on interplayer roleplay outside games. In addition, taking the most chaotic path for no reason other than for seeing the world burn is generally frowned upon and is termed “Chaotic Stupid”. This is because this derails the adventure that the DM has painstakingly crafted, and affects the experience of your teammates who may want to play seriously.

This is not to say you cannot attempt antics. You just have to use your judgment to determine when is the time for it. Befriending the villager or the misunderstood villain? Go ahead! Taking an impromptu shopping trip with said villager, or trying to befriend the mindless mummy screaming death in your face? Probably a bad call that stalls the experience for everyone else.

As a rule of thumb, if the game is approaching the 8th hour and someone is already commenting they need to sleep soon, now is a good time to wrap things up and not a good time to attempt antics.

### Time is Wonky

In most video games, progression is in real time. This is also true for our roleplay channels. However, in combat, time is usually handwaved or dictated by the DM. This is because D&D is designed such that a round (where everyone gets a turn) lasts 6 seconds. 10 rounds is a full minute. 

Yet, in real life, each turn usually takes a couple of minutes, and a round can last an hour or more. D&D battles also usually don’t hit the 10 round mark. As such, in order to retain the epicness of battle, suspension of belief is required.

### There is No Save Point/Auto Respawn

In D&D, revivals are expensive and as such usually unavailable to low levels. The cheapest revival method costs 300gp (*Revivify*) and requires a class available to cast it within one minute of death. Once you die in a game, unless you are immediately revived, you are out of the game. Your friends or guild mates will have to arrange the revival for you, if they want to and can afford it.

As such, suicide plays are not encouraged. Retreats are usually available and can be the best option if you deem the battle unwinnable. Just be sure to communicate with your party before retreating, as abandoning your teammates is bad form.

### You Don’t Have to Kill All Enemies

Unlike games, where video game characters are programmed to do a certain set of actions, there are infinite possibilities in D&D. As such, you can choose other courses of action, such as befriending, negotiating, or tricking enemies into noncombat. Just see the section about teamwork above.

## Character Roles

Now for the fun stuff! In multiplayer games, you may be familiar with certain concepts of character roles. We will go over those basic concepts and how they interact with D&D’s rule system. 

It should be noted that with how many subclasses and feats have been released since D&D 5e’s original publication, every class can be built to fulfill tankiness, damage, or support roles. Some are just designed to do it better than others; Other classes can do this but only with specific builds. This guide is just to give you a simplistic idea.

Contents:
- Tank
- DPS
- Summoner
- Healer
- Support

### Tank

A tank is someone with a lot of health, designed to take the brunt of enemy damage. This role relies on good positioning and builds that aggro enemies as well as punishes them for attacking teammates. This is best displayed in the **Barbarian** class, as well as **the** Fighter class to a slightly less extent. 

To maximize tankiness, sink your highest stats into **Constitution**, in order to increase your **Hit Points** (HP). This will increase the amount of damage you can take. At higher levels, you can also take feats that increase your health, such as **Tough**.

Also be sure to increase your **Armor Class** (AC) as much as possible. This determines the minimum roll needed to hit you, and the higher the better. AC depends on two things: your **Dexterity** score and the armor you are wearing (determined by your class and affordability).

Dexterity determines how agile you are and in turn how hard you are to hit. As with Constitution, the higher the stat you allocate for this, the better. Your Dexterity modifier (not to be confused with score) is added to your base armor to give your final AC. For example, if you are wearing Leather armor, and you have a Dexterity score of 14, your AC is 


> `11 [Base Armor for Leather] +2 [Dexterity modifier] =13`


Classes designed to be tanky such as Barbarian and Fighter will give you access to medium or heavy armor, which allows you to have higher AC. Barbarian also has Unarmored Defense, which allows you to forgo armor and instead only use your Dexterity modifier. As you level and save more money, you will also be able to afford more expensive armor, which will increase your AC.

### DPS

A DPS is someone who does a lot of damage but sacrifices other aspects such as health and utility. This role relies on good movement as well as builds that have both reliable damage and features/spells that mitigates hits. Although many classes in D&D fit this category, it is most evident in **Fighter, Rogue, Monk, Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard**.

To maximize your damage, be sure to sink your highest stats into the stat you use to attack. For Rogues and Monks, this is Dexterity, and for spellcasters, this is referred to as your casting stat and defers by class.

It should be noted not all spells, feats, or subclasses are created equal. Some are more situational than others. If you love optimizing your character, you are advised to research guides and discuss with other players for your ideal build. 

#### Special Mention: Glass Cannons

Wizard deserves a special mention for the fact that they are the prime example of a **Glass Cannon**. Their d6 hit die paired with no bonus to constitution saves (unlike the Sorcerer) makes them susceptible to both weapons and spells. However, at higher levels, they gain more and more abilities to counter these.

#### Special Mention: AOE damage

Some classes have access to spells that dole out Area of Effect (AOE) damage. AOE damage affects all creatures standing within a certain area as designated by the spell. 

D&D **has friendly fire**, and you can harm your teammates if you do not position your spells properly. In worst case scenarios, especially for a specific spell called Fireball, this can cause your teammates to die. 

As such, it is impertinent that you communicate with your teammates on the turn before you unleash a high damage AOE spell in an area they are standing on. This is such that they can move out of the way, or if they can’t, you should reconsider the spell you are using.

### Summoner

A Summoner is someone who summons multiple creatures in order to divide the attention of enemies, giving the party more room to attack the enemies. Creatures can usually attack enemies themselves, and are controlled by the player. This role relies on maintaining concentration of the spell while also making use of positioning.

While this could technically fall under DPS, it gets a special mention because of the fact that **D&D is not designed to support summoners**. D&D’s initiative system means that each creature summoned has to perform actions individually, and even if creatures are grouped, due to their numerous nature, they usually take time to act. As such, it can make combat grind to a halt.

That said, if you really want to play a Summoner, the **Druid** is the best example of this, as it gives you access to most spells that start with “Conjure” or “Summon”. To a lesser extent, **Ranger** also gives you access to “Conjure Animals”, the lowest level and most commonly used summoning spell. The Ranger subclass Beast Master also gives you access to an animal companion at 3rd level.

For summoners, as your need to maintain concentration is impertinent, you may consider taking feats such as War Caster or Resilient: Constitution.

### Healer

A Healer is someone whose main ability is restoring lost health to their teammates. As with how multiplayer games are usually played, Healers tend to be few in number and are thus higher in demand. 

It should be noted D&D does not have any classes that are designed to only heal. Healers can usually do other things which overlaps with the DPS or Support category. That said, classes that are best at healing are the **Cleric, Bard, and Druid**. 

Some classes or subclasses have features that provide small amounts of healing. This is usually termed as backup heals and is found in the Paladin and Ranger classes as well as the Celestial Warlock, Divine Soul Sorcerer, Alchemist Artificer and Way of Mercy Monk subclasses. However, as these heals are small and usually come as a sacrifice for other abilities, it is recommended that each party has a designated healer and the backup is reserved for when the main healer is down.

Still, because of the aforementioned way of how D&D is designed, classes can only be effective healers if the character is built to fulfill that role. Case in point, if you do not pick any healing spells, you would simply be a DPS or Support class despite playing a Bard. It's recommended that you pick at least one healing spell if you play one of these classes, as people tend to expect some mode of backup healing if you are part of the party.

D&D is also designed in such a way that it is much more effective to deal out damage (hence stopping the enemy) as compared to healing damage taken. As such, you should consider timing heals for teammates at low health or when they are unconscious. Keep in mind spell slots (and in turn healing) is limited and should be conserved.

If you want to do some healing but your class does not have healing abilities, consider purchasing a Healer’s Kit and taking the Healer feat. 

### Support

A Support is someone who usually aids the team in buffs, debuffs, or skill checks, at the cost of being less effective at dealing damage. During combat, help to control the battlefield and make the battle go faster by helping teammates do their jobs better. Outside of combat, they assist in skill checks by usually having high modifiers in many skills, thus increasing chances of success. They might also be equipped with spells or items that give some mode of utility, such as invisibility or the ability to breath underwater.

This is most evident in the **Bard, Rogue, and Artificer** classes. The former two are also considered Skill Monkeys, due to their access to **Expertise** for some skills of their choice, making their chances of success almost guaranteed at high level.

If you want to increase your level of utility, consider taking feats such as Skilled, Skill Expert, Inspiring Leader, or Ritual Caster.
