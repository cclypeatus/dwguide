## Introduction

So you’ve been looking at all the cool kids with their funky rainbow color roles and thinking about joining the staff. Great! We are always welcome to have more staff join our team. In fact, joining staff is one of the best ways you can help us! After all, we’re always in need of more hands for implementing changes, helping players and increasing activity, all while helping as well yourself by increasing the server’s quality of life!

However, we do our best to make sure applicants are a good fit, and that might mean delaying or rejecting an application that we feel need more time. We like to make sure all staff are productive additions to our team and bring a positive attitude. That being said, this document is designed to give you a more in-depth overview of the various staff roles so that you can pick the one that suits you best. It also gives you tips on how to write your application so that you don’t undersell yourself.

## Minimum Criteria

This criteria is what we look out for when vetting for all staff role applications. There are some exceptions to this criteria depending on the role you are applying for. If you aren’t sure, you can go ahead and apply, but be warned that these exceptions are quite rare.

- No recent Demerit Points
    - Having no DPs at all is an advantage, but we take into account context and the role applied.
- No lesser courthouses **relevant to the role applied for**
    - E.g. If you are applying for Thrall and were recently lessered for DTD mistakes, we may decline the application on the basis of needing better familiarity.
- No demonstration of hostile or passive aggressive attitude
- Not removed from staff before due to poor performance
- Sufficient recent activity
- Has not submitted a denied application recently 

## Tips on Writing Your Application

### Attention to Detail

This may seem obvious, but your application is judged for the amount of care you put into it. Here are some simple errors to avoid making so that your application isn’t rejected right off the bat.

- Spelling/Grammatical Errors
    - Especially for role names, staff names, and lore-related names
- Using the wrong application format
    - For staff, please use the one in `#staff-guide`
- Not using the application format at all
    - If you send a FanMail saying “I’d like to apply for staff!” you will be directed to `#staff-roles`
- Not filling out all fields in an application

### Length

Try to give us as many relevant details as you can, but don’t overdo it. Avoid giving one liners as this does not really tell us much about you and can make it seem like you didn’t put much effort into it. If you do not have experience, try to talk about why you are passionate about helping, or what you plan to do if given the role. 

In general, keeping it within one message and filling out the space with useful information is a good call. If your application looks very short or empty, this might be a sign to write more. Don’t extend into a second message

Please note: We get a lot of applications for DM roles that list home campaigns as relevant experience. While this can be useful, we are more interested in knowing the “soft” skills you learned from DMing. This is because traditional campaigns are very different from West Marches, and can vary in quality. Tell us about how you might have learned to resolve conflict at the table, or when a game went badly and how you grew from that experience. 

### Relevant Experience

This is what you can include in your application when asked about your experience. If you have not done anything from this section, it may be worth trying them out. This will both give you an idea of whether the role suits you, and give us a better idea of how you are like. It’s worth noting that you can include experience even if you don’t plan on applying to a similar role, as it may still be relevant.

#### On Server

- Helping newbies, whether in PMs, OOC channels, or IC channels
- Reviewing sheets
- Welcoming new members in `#introductions`
- Reports in `#community-efforts`
- Custom aliases

#### Off Server

- DMing in private campaigns (In person or digital)
- DMing for game stores
- Custom original maps
- Equivalent roles in other servers
- Personal writing
- Personal projects
- Related work experience (e.g. spreadsheets)
- Related school work (e.g. essays or clubs)


### Misc. Tips

- Don’t spam applications
    - Send a maximum of two at one time and wait for a reply
    - Do not send more applications if you have not received a response
    - Consistently applying to multiple roles is a surefire way to get your app rejected. We want people who are passionate about their role and not just wanting to be staff for the power.
- Don’t harass staff about the status of your application, especially in public
    - Staff often need time to consider an application, especially if a lot of the review committee is busy that week. 
- Don’t try to guilt trip staff about your application
    - No one staff is responsible for the result of your application. Complaining in front of them is just inconsiderate.

### Rating System

The overview of the roles below will be based on 6 criteria. This is a subjective opinion and may not be representative of your experience; however, they are general enough to provide you an idea of what to expect. A low or high score is not necessarily a good or bad thing; it depends on what you want out of the role.

The 6 criteria are:

- **Time Commitment**
    - This refers to the amount of prolonged periods you are expected to spend on a task for the role
    - A score of 1 means 5 minutes or less at a time while a score of 5 means 6 hours or more.
- **Learning Curve**
    - This represents the amount of effort needed to pick up and improve on the role
    - A score of 1 means you can start right away, while a score of 5 means you will spend most of your time honing your skill.
- **Collaborativeness**
    - This refers to the amount of time you will be spent working on your own vs with other staff.
    - A score of 1 means you will be almost always working on your own, while a score of 5 means everything you do will be in a team.
- **Variety**
    - This refers to the variety of tasks available within a role
    - A score of 1 means tasks are relatively repetitive, while a score of 5 means you will constantly need to learn and pick up new things
- **Public Facing**
    - This refers to the amount of work that requires you to deal with the player base outside of staff
    - A score of 1 means that you will never need to work with the public, while a score of 5 means that you need to consider your responses very carefully.
- **Initiative**
    - This refers to the amount of proactiveness you need to have in order to perform your job to its maximum
    - A score of 1 means that the role is reactive depending on what is needed, while a score of 5 means you need to constantly source for your own tasks.
