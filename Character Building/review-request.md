## Reacts

- 👀 means it is being reviewed
- 📝 means it has been reviewed

## For Requesters

You can request a review of your character sheet from a volunteer experienced player. Whether you are new to the game, levelling up, or are trying out a new piece of homebrew, as long as you want a second pair of eyes, this is the place for you.

Please note that a review is OPTIONAL and is NOT GUARANTEED. You do NOT need a review to RP, do DTD, or play a game. In addition, reviews are based on availability. Volunteers are busy and may not have time to review your sheet/are not familiar with your sheet type, so please do not harass them by pinging them or DMing them.

### Template

## For Volunteers

### General Requirements

While we do not have formal requirements for reviewing, we request volunteers self-appraise themselves to see if they think they are fit to review.

- Have intermediate knowledge on D&D<br>
You don't have to know homebrew or the class features of every class, just have a good eye for spotting fishy numbers and be willing to look up features you don't know.
- Have a patient temperament<br>
If you find yourself quickly frustrated, reviewing may not be right for you
- Ability to read and process information<br>
Since sheets consist of many parts, attention to detail is needed

### Review Etiquette

Again, this is not strictly enforced, however, if repeated incidents occur, one may be banned from reviewing.

- When reviewing, please create a thread from the sheet and ping the requester in it
- Please review sheets in a chronological manner as much as possible<br>
If you feel that a sheet is out of your realm of knowledge (such as if it is a sheet type you are not familiar with or a homebrew you have not used), please ping a Welcomer.
- Communicate in a clear and actionable manner<br>
Please give detailed responses about mistakes. Rather than saying "Your AC is wrong", describe what specifically is wrong, e.g. they forgot to account for dexterity bonus, and what it should be.
- Give accurate advice<br>
Obviously, mistakes will happen. But if you find yourselves constantly miscalculating things, maybe you should look up more information or get more familiar with the game.

### Sheet Review Checklist

- Check armor and AC.
- What's their HP? Assume average. If it doesn't add up, check for rolls or ask them.
- Check skills and other proficiencies like tools & languages. Class, race and background will contribute to these. Generally, class gives 2, Races give 1 sometimes, and Background gives 2<br>
D&D Beyond does not display background. This can sometimes be circumvented by hovering over their languages, which will state the source. If this does not work, directly ping them to ask.
- Spell save DC, bonus, and spells known. (If applicable)
- Inventory. Usually just have to see if they have anything outside of starting gear or crazy expensive. <br>
This does not apply to characters that are already significantly levelled.

!!!warning
If the character has already been in games since creation/levelling and you spot mistakes, please flag the sheet for Mod review. Do NOT further engage with the user or ping them informing them of their mistakes.
