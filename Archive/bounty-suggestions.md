- ‚ùå The suggestion has been rejected.
‚ùó  or [post deleted]: Does not follow guidelines of bounty suggestions

## Bounty Suggestion Format

Please try to give thoughtful and inspired ideas. This will help the DMs.

**Suggestion:** A brief summary of your idea for a bounty. This doesn't have to include your character, but can. This should not be about exploring their personal backstory, but instead be a fun story hook that anyone can participate in to go on a new adventure. If necessary, you can make up lore that could reasonably exist or that has not been explored/established. You are not allowed to make suggestions for fighting specific monsters or specify the level range.

**Location (Optional):** Suggestions for what the setting would be, such as the tundra, the Snowhaven sewers, or an abandoned mining town. You could even suggest other already established locations like Floreopolis!

## Important Notes

- Please only suggest 1 bounty per week.
- Please read the channel topic to learn what this channel is about
- All bounties are subjected to DMs' interest and availability. Even a suggestion is popular, there is no guarantee that it will be run.
- Suggesting a bounty does not mean you are guaranteed to be picked by the DM if the suggestion is run.
- If you were the suggester and your bounty was picked up to run, you are not allowed to suggest to the DM the composition of the party, whether to benefit yourself or someone else

## Definition of Lore that Could Reasonably Exist

In simple terms, what you are allowed to do for your backstory and slightly more without approval. It should meet the following criteria:

- Would exist in a medieval fantasy world. As Icris isn't the same as Earth, it doesn't have to be super accurate as long as it makes sense to your average observer.
  - ‚úÖ Travelling companies, mercenary groups, cults
  - ‚ùå Robot invasions, isekai, 4th wall breaking
- Not overly specific to the point of doing the DM's job for them. No name dropping or specifying monsters.
  - ‚úÖ Kids disappearing, strange chanting heard at the edges of the woods, livestock showing up dead
  - ‚ùå Lich wants to take over the world and kidnapping kids for experiments, rituals are for raising zombies, werewolves are on the loose

Misc. clarifications for where bounties can take place in:
- ‚úÖ Planes
- ‚úÖ Cities other than Snowhaven
- ‚úÖ Underdark

## Examples

**Suggestion:** The [blank]  has been running low on funds recently, and it's looking increasingly likely that it will have to shut down either in part or in full. While the caretakers tried their best to ensure that the news didn't reach the children, a few managed to overhear anyways; it soon became an open secret among the orphans. Having seen adventurers stop by every once in a while, a few of the older kids managed to scrape together their savings, sneak out at night, and post a notice on the bulletin board with the hope of hiring a few to investigate whether some old rumors about an abandoned stash of treasure nearby are actually true...

**Suggestion:**  [Blank] is under direct attack. There are different groups fighting together in different parts of town, while others try to get civilians to safety and prevent damages. The situation is dire, and it seems there is a powerful leader pulling the strings of this invasion that needs to be dealt with before the town gets overrun.

**Suggestion:** Recently, a theater was hired by certain individuals to put on a performance for upcoming celebrations. Rehearsals, however, have not gone as smoothly as expected, as a series of misfortune strikes the company mere days from opening night.
