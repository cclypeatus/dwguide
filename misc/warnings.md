If you are ever unsure of something like whether your character is legal, whether you're adding XP/RPXP correctly, whether a certain kind of behavior is allowed, or anything else, please ask about it in #server-questions, #beginner-help, or #rulings-questions. The staff team is here to help, and we want to help you avoid trouble in the future.

Don't assume something is okay if you have doubts. Rereading the rules and/or asking in the proper channels is always better than getting called here, and helps prevent it from happening at all.

## Courthouse Channels

Don't react unless necessary to anything here in `#courthouse` or `#lesser-courthouse`.

The purpose of this Lesser Courthouse is for Mods to ping you on things they want you to do that may not be entirely an offence, such as combining your evil plans entry into one post. It is like a summoning channel.

  Tips to make this experience more pleasant for all of us
+ Be polite to the mods. They are just doing their job and act on behalf of the mod team.
+ Take your punishment with grace. If you would like to contest a ruling, please send a private FanMail so that we may explain our reasonings in detail, and not complain about it openly.
- Don't try to fix a mistake during the investigation process. When the mods have came to a decision, they will tell you if you need to fix your counters and how it should be fixed.
- Don't try to conceal evidence during the investigation process such as editing messages and tampering with counters. The mods will know if you intentionally tried to hide something from us, which will increase your punishment.
- Don't suggest a suitable punishment for yourself. That is the mods' job. 
- Don't freak out that you're going to get banned
```

You are reminded that by agreeing to enter the server, you agree to obey our rules and accept any punishment for rulebreaking that we deem fit, even if you do not agree with them.

## Self Report Rules

After submitting a self report, do not signup or join DM events with the affected character(s) until your self report has been addressed, to avoid complicating your logs further. 

Not all errors need to be reported. Please refer to this non-exhaustive list regarding what should and should not be submitted.

Should:
- Illegal stats in DM events
- Desertions in DM events
- Illegal bonuses in DTDs
- Using banned content or outdated content
- Adding illegal XP to a character / not tracking XP properly
- 5e rules mistakes made over the course of multiple official games

Should Not:
- Logging DTDs, transactions, exp, etc. in the incorrect channel if it's already been fixed (if it has not been fixed, go to <#586697587932004362> and ask a Bookkeeping Assistant to help you)
- Accidental swears
- 5e rules mistakes during one game or spar
