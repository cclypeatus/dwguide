## Guidelines for Partner Servers

Partner servers are for server admins who mutually agree to advertise each other's servers in a public channel, so that members can check them out. Members might otherwise not encounter these servers, and in this way both sides benefit with more members.

1) Your server should have at least 500 members. This does not apply to existing partnered servers.

2) The server should not condone racism, sexism, homophobia or other forms of harassment.

3) While your server does not need to be family-friendly like ours, we will not partner with any servers that promote ERP. All NSFW content should be restricted to locked channels and not linked in public chats.

4) Our advertisement should remain on your server for as long as the server is active, and in exchange we guarantee the same. If there are any changes to your partner policy and our ad is taken down, please notify us.

5) Our advertisement should be listed in an obvious place, preferably a public channel visible to all verified members. If your server uses a partner bot or partners with such frequency that our ad will get lost, we will not partner.

6) Your server should be relatively active. In order to keep our list of partner servers relevant and up to date, we do not partner with inactive or on-hiatus servers. 

7) We are not interested in partnering with non TTRPG related servers

If you meet all of the above criteria, please send a partnership request to `@FanMail` by filing out this template:
