## Guidelines for Partner Servers

Partner servers are for server admins who mutually agree to advertise each other's servers in a public channel, so that members can check them out. Members might otherwise not encounter these servers, and in this way both sides benefit with more members.

1) Your server should have at least 500 members. This does not apply to existing partnered servers.

2) The server should not condone racism, sexism, homophobia or other forms of harassment.

3) While your server does not need to be family friendly like ours, we will not partner with any servers that promote ERP. All NSFW content should be contained to locked channels and not in public chats. Servers that partner with ERP servers will also be denied partnership.

4) Our advertisement should remain on your server for as long as the server is running, and in exchange we guarantee the same on our side. If there are any changes to your server's policy regarding partner servers and we become ineligible, we should receive some form of notice before our ad is taken down. If we discover that your side has not upheld this, we will remove the ad from our side.

5) Our advertisement should be listed in an obvious place, preferably a public channel visible to all verified members. If your server uses partner bot or partners with such frequency that our ad will get lost, we will not partner.

6) Your server should be relatively active. We will not partner with dead servers that only have new messages once every few days. We will reconsider partnership if your server dies.

7) We are not interested in partnering with non TTRPG related servers
