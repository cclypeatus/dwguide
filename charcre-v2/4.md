## What is a backstory?
> Addresses those new to D&D the role of a backstory, and explains the difference from background. Especially important if we ever adopt 5.5e. We currently have a skeleton of this info for the `!library` doc.

## Making a backstory for the server
> Copy pasted from <#660382373493604362>. Briefly explains West Marches and how this affects backstory. Content is also in the `!library` doc.

- It is important to note that your character's backstory will most likely not be explored here. Hence, the backstory is primarily for your roleplay.
- By submitting your backstory and lore to this server, you agree that it becomes open to DM interpretation.

### Level 1 Character in a Collaborative Story

> - What you did in your backstory must make sense for a Level 1 character's capabilities. For example, you cannot be famous or notorious at the world-wide scale, or have committed mass slaughter.
> - Beware of Chosen One Syndrome. You are a part of the collaborative storytelling, not the main character of a novel.
> 
> - Your backstory cannot contain any non-family-friendly topics such as sexual assault of any degree, slavery, pedophilia, etc. When in doubt, err on the side of caution, or in case you are unsure, send a message to `@FanMail` for confirmation.

### World Setting

> - The world map and general world setting information can be found in `#lore` 
> - If you have any lore questions for your backstory, message `@FanMail` with the specific question and motive. 
> - The pantheon of Icris can be found in `#pantheon`, and the Members of the Council (Archdevils) can be found in `#hell-inc`
> 
> !!!warning
> No guns or firearm lookalikes exist in this world. No sci-fi, no references to other franchises, no urban technology, no references to events on Earth.
> !!!

> For more DnD World lore, please visit our [World Anvil page](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/icris-dnd-world).
> 
> - Your backstory must take place in Icris. You cannot be a planeshifter, come from another plane such as the Feywild/Shadowfell/Elemental Planes, or come from another continent or Underdark.
> - You cannot invent major world changing events such as natural disasters or war.
> - You cannot be in a current/former position of royalty, e.g. King/Queen, Prince/Princess.
> 
> - You cannot follow a god from another pantheon (e.g. Forgotten Realms) and you cannot invent your own god.
> - If you are a cleric, you must follow god(s) from Icris pantheon: `#pantheon`.

### Miscellaneous

> - Your backstory cannot be based off religious text such as the Bible, or directly pulled from a video game/book series/franchise. 
> - Your backstory cannot have far-fetched concepts like being frozen in time, or contain powerful or legendary magic items.
> 
> - It is optional, but recommended, that you write your backstory in `#character-biopic`.
