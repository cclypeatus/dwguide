!!!info NOTE: Please be sure to read the rules before logging any registries.
In particular:
>  You also need to RP your prayer in ‚Å†`#temple-to-the-gods`, `#shrines-to-the-gods` or `#cultists-shrine`.
> 
> Don't log for petty matters such as: [...] Questions that can be answered by a priest or found in the library

If there is no valid prayer to a specific god *prior to the check being made*, the prayer will not be answered.

In addition, please do not pray for a god/devil to give the PC a specific purpose or something in particular for them to do - Temple Speakers are not DMs, and we cannot create personal quests for players to carry out. 

If there is something you have in mind - such as using the prayer to RP a MC or as flavor for leveling/gaining features - that is very awesome to do; please put that in the notes. Creating individualized tasks for PCs is outside our scope, however.
!!!

## Rules

- Fill in all availabilities in EST

- You can only schedule an appointment with 1 NPC per log

- Do not make another log until the one in queue has been resolved

- Once you have successfully gone through with your appointment, you can only make another appointment after 24 hours.

- Refrain from interrupting scheduled appointments where characters are talking to NPCs. Ask for permission OOC first.

- Please avoid making time urgent logs as staff are volunteers and they may not be handled in time

- Talking to potential employers does not replace a Find DTD

- Regular NPC Encounters (non-deity) do not have a DC and you do not need to RP booking the appointment.

-  Temple/Shrine encounters have a DC your Religion roll has to meet as stated in `#pantheon`. You also need to RP your prayer in `#temple-to-the-gods`, `#shrines-to-the-gods` or `#cultists-shrine`. If you get a Nat 1 or a negative, log it as well. A successful Divine Intervention to a deity automatically counts as a successful Religion check.

- Prayers that are not resolved within 1 year due to player inactivity or general scheduling impossibility are automatically removed.

## Regular NPC Encounters

## Temple/Shrine Specific Rules

### Praying

- You must RP your prayer before rolling
- If your prayer has failed to catch the attention of any deity, you **do not** need to log it. This happens when your roll
  - does not meet the DC or higher
  - is not a Nat 1
  - is not a negative result
<br><br>
- Don't log for petty matters such as:
  - Asking for blessings
  - Asking for protection
  - Criticism of a god
  - Praise of a god
  - Questions that can be answered by a priest or found in the library
  - etc.
- Don't pray to a god for:
  - Mechanical benefits, e.g. favors and magical items
  - Something out of their domain, e.g. don't pray to Lerksa for knowledge on what happened to your parents, or Juvia on the best beauty tips.
<br><br>
- If you have successfully met the DC, do not make another prayer until that one has been resolved
- In the event that you fail, you can only retry your prayer after 48 hours have passed.
- You can only pray to **one** god at any time
- This system only works in the temple/shrine channels, unless otherwise specified.
<br><br>
- If you pray with someone else for the same god, only one person should roll and log, but they can make their roll at an advantage. Note this in the [`#npc-registry`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/545107769951518740) form
- Nat 1s/negatives result in catching the attention of another deity. Vice versa, a Nat 20 might result in the appearance of more than one god.
- Indicate in the notes if your prayer is time urgent

### During the Shrine

- Refrain from interrupting scenes where characters are consulting gods. Ask for permission OOC first.
- You are not allowed to pray to another god while interacting with one
- Trying to trick the gods is a bad idea. For example, as a neutral aligned god who has superiors to report to Juvia will not cause mass destruction just so that more deaths will be caused
- It is unwise to disrespect the gods. In the event the gods smite you to death due to deliberate aggression of the player (not due to bad rolls), you are not allowed to create a new character until one month has passed.

### After the Shrine

- There is a 24h cooldown from the end of the shrine before you can pray again
- While shrines do not count as DM events and hence are not eligible to claim RPXP to your xp tracker, you can still gain RPXP as if you were RPing
