# Downtime Days
**Downtime Day (DTD)** activities can enable you to earn some extra gold, copy spells, and other neat features.

## DownTime Days (DTD) Rules

- You have 5 DTD points per week when you pay lifestyle, and they expire every Monday at midnight server time (EST). Therefore, you may not stock up the unused DTD points.
- You can only do 1 DTD per day. The day is determined by the server time (EST).
- Lifestyle and other factors may affect the DC for your rolls. The details are intentionally undisclosed to prevent min-maxing and metagaming.
- Only passive effects may be applied, for example: Jack of All Trades, proficiency, Expertise, Tireless Precision.
- Some DTDs require manual reviews from staff, and this may take more than one day. You do not need to wait for the previous day‚Äôs manual DTD to be processed before doing today‚Äôs DTD.

## Find

Use Find DTD to find:
> - Employer for Part-Time Work DTD
> - Employer for High-Risk Work DTD
> - Guild aide
> - Medical help (for injury recovery)

DMs may use Find DTD for other purposes.

For each Find DTD, you need following information:
> - **Seeking**: What/Who you are looking for
> - **Search Location**: Area/Region of Snowhaven where you are searching. An RP channel name.
> - **Search Method**: Description of your search
> - **Skill**: Choose from Perception, Investigation, or Persuasion

*Not everything can be found in the humble village of Snowhaven, nor is everything known. It may be impossible to Find some things, although if you're lucky you might stumble upon clues as to where would be a better place to look.*

Put this command with the information in `#dtd-manual-log`:

```
!find <Seeking> <Search Location> <Search Method> <Skill>
```

> Example: `!find "Employment at a smithy" "Market District" "Searching the market district for any signs of a forge by checking the skies for smoke and listening for the sounds of hammers on metal." "Investigation"`

You will receive a ping in `#dtd-results` when your log is processed.

## Job Interview Checks

Once you have found an employer for Part-Time Work DTD, or High-Risk Work DTD, you will be asked to make job interview checks in the ‚Å†`#dtd-results` post.

- Job Interviews __do not__ use DTD points.

## Special Case: Catch-Up DTD

Catch-Up DTD is for characters who returned from being Quest-Locked for a multi-session bounty. The number of DTD points are determined by the DM at the end of the bounty.

### Catch-Up DTD Rules

- You need to pay the lifestyle cost in order to perform the Catch-Up DTDs. Each lifestyle payment covers 5 DTD points, just as the normal lifestyle payment does.
- Catch-Up DTDs can be performed all in one day. 
- You need to use up the Catch-Up DTD points **before** attending any other DM events or performing normal DTDs. Unused Catch-Up DTD points are voided.
- For automated DTDs, make sure to **add a note** indicating that you are performing Catch-Up DTDs.
- **Injuries** are accumulated as normal during the Catch-Up. For the injury recovery purposes, consider there is one long rest per each day of catch-up DTD, and for each set of 5 DTDs, consider there to be 7 long rests.
